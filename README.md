# SystemMonitor
This is a simple Python program that uses the psutil library to monitor system information and displays it in a Tkinter GUI. The program also includes a bar chart of the CPU usage over time, created with the Matplotlib library.  This project served me as a way to get familiar with Matplotlib and how to use it to create visualizations.
